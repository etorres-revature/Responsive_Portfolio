##Why Responsive Web Design?

As more and more people access the internet from a growing variety of devices, front-end web developers must master the skills of responsive web design to ensure a consistent user-experience across multiple screen sizes.

In responsive design, page elements reconfigure as the viewport (or, screen size) grows or shrinks.  A web page that displays as three-columns on a desktop may display as two-columns on a tablet or one-column on a smartphone.  Therefore, the same HTML code is delivered to each device; however, using CSS its appearance can be optimized for screen displays to rearrange the appearance of the page to fit the device on which it is being viewed. 

This save time (and, time = money) because front-end developers only have to create a single web page.  Then the principles of responsive web design can be utilized to create a unique web design for wide-screen monitors, desktops, laptops, tablets, and phones of any and all sizes.  All from a single codebasse!!

Put into its most simplest terms:
